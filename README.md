# 🌻 Sunflower Wedding – RSVP Application

Project developed for **wedding RSVP (attendance confirmation)**, built with a strong focus on simplicity, user experience, and modern front-end and backend-as-a-service best practices.

This repository is part of my **professional portfolio**, showcasing the integration of React, Supabase, Vercel, and v0.

## 🔗 Live Demo

The application is available in production:

---

## 🧩 Overview

Sunflower Wedding is a website where guests can:

* Confirm their attendance at the wedding
* Provide basic participation details
* Enjoy a simple, responsive, and intuitive experience

The project was designed to be:

* **Lightweight and fast**
* **Mobile-first**
* **Easy to maintain and extend**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React** – User interface development
* **v0.app** – Rapid front-end generation and iteration
* **Supabase** – Backend (Database + API)
* **Vercel** – Deployment and hosting

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

* **Front-end:** React
* **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + REST API)
* **Deployment:** Vercel
* **CI/CD:** Automatic deployment on every push to the repository

The project stays automatically synchronized with **v0.app**, enabling fast iterations on layout and visual components.

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployment is fully handled by **Vercel**, providing:

* Fast builds
* Branch previews
* A stable production environment

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Layout and components are created and iterated using **v0.app**
2. Changes are automatically synchronized to this repository

* Demonstrate proficiency in **modern React development**
